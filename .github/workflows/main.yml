Your updated workflow should look like this:

```yaml
name: Main

on:
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}

      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          bundler-cache: true

      - name: Run tests
        run: bundle exec rails test
```

This workflow now includes the "permissions" section with "contents: write" and "pull-requests: write" as per your request.
